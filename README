Mrs.Clever strategy:
Mrs.Clever goes over the board row by row
and search for empty cell, with  this strategy if the other player
didnt put his murk right after hers, after some turns she can have a sequence and win
the probability that the random player will put his mark exactly after hers is not so high,
in that case Mrs.Clever will be able to continue to put murks one after another and win .
in case that the cell is not empty,she will go to another one by rows,
and in the end the probability that she will succeed in making sequence  without the random player blocks her is high.

Mr.Whatever implementation:
Mr.Whatever chooses randomly coordinates(for the row and col).
if the chosen place in the board is not empty , he continues to choose random coordinates until empty cell is found
and the putMark function places his mark.

Mr.Snartypamts strategy:
Mr.Snartypamts goes over the board column by column starting from the second column
and search for empty cell, with this strategy he will block mrs.Clever step and will have a sequence faster
than her
